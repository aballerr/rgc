Thanks!

The purpose of this node module is to be a simple react client tool.  For now, it only generates components.  It has limited configuration currently. This is still in beta, so any feedback would be greatly appreciated! 

## Installation
	$npm install -g rgc
## Prerequisites
I haven't had time to test it's backward comparability yet, but it's compatible for node v8.12.0 at the least


### Usage:

	$rgc --help

### Generating a new component
	$rgc new COMPONENT_NAME
### Setting Config Options
	$rgc config
### To Print Config Options
	$rgc print

  

## Options:

-V, --version Output the version number

-p, --pure Create a Pure Component

-h, --help Output usage information
